This directory should contain a set of sound files to be used by the IVR system.
They need to be in a format for which you have a player - eg. wav, mp3.
You need to specify the format in the script, or in commandline options.

Supplied are a free set I made myself - don't expect high quality!
Better quality versions of these can be found all over the internet, often
in sets intended for asterisk IVR systems 
- eg. http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+sound+files 

Digit sound files correspond to spoken digits, "0", "1", "2", etc.
The menuheader sound file is played at the start of each set of menu 
announcements - eg. "menuheader" "1" "shutdown" "2" "reboot" "3" "exit".

This is the current full listing of sound files required:
(They could be mp3 or wav, or something else)
